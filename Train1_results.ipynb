        "\n",
        "The purpose of an After Action Report is to examine the actions of the Town of High \n",
        "Rivers Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) in response to the June 2013 flooding \n",
        "event to determine successes, challenges, lessons learned and recommendations. \n",
        "This report summarizes the After Action Report of the June 2013 High River Flood in \n",
        "respect to the Town of High Rivers Emergency Management Program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although there were numerous organizations that provided support to the response, \n",
        "the scope and focus of the After Action Report is on the Emergency Operations Centre \n",
        "and the coordination role that it played in directing the overall response from June \n",
        "20 to the end of July. It is important to note that the report does not address the \n",
        "subsequent recovery/renewal operations that have taken place and continue to take \n",
        "place in High River.\n",
        "\n",
        "METHODOLOGY: \n",
        "\n",
        "Information for the After Action Report was compiled from several sources, including the following:\n",
        "\n",
        " an event chronology based on scribe notes, press releases, personnel feedback, and corroboration with \n",
        "partner agency timelines;\n",
        " analysis of ICS 221 demobilization forms collected from EOC response personnel by the Demobilization Unit \n",
        "in the EOC; \n",
        " facilitated interviews with more than 150 personnel, including: Town staff, non-governmental organizations; \n",
        "Family and Community Services and Emergency Social Services personnel from across the province, external \n",
        "response organizations, provincial government personnel and utility company personnel;\n",
        " collaboration on content development with Town staff personnel; and\n",
        " fact-checking and feedback from relevant organizations on specific sections of the report.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS: \n",
        "\n",
        "The report was developed from the perspective of the Town of High River, with the ultimate goal of providing lessons \n",
        "learned and recommendations for the improvement of its Emergency Management Program. As a result, the bulk of \n",
        "the interviews were conducted with Town employees. All recommendations in this report are from the perspective of \n",
        "the Town of High River for the Towns use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        " There were thousands of individuals who contributed to the response in High River. For logistical reasons as \n",
        "well as the specific scope of this document, it was not possible to collect feedback from all responders. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\f\n",
        " Interview requests were sent to key organizations and partner agencies, but staff turnover and availability \n",
        "meant that it was not always the individuals on the ground that provided feedback on behalf of their \n",
        "organizations.\n",
        " The focus of the report is on the functionality of the EOC, so organizations that primarily provided support to \n",
        "the field or on early recovery without a notable presence in the EOC were not included in this report.\n",
        " This report does not address either the concurrent or subsequent recovery/renewal operations that have \n",
        "taken place and continue to take place in High River.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The Alberta flood of June 2013 was the largest natural \n",

        "\n",
        "The purpose of an After Action Report is to examine the actions of the Town of High \n",
        "Rivers Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) in response to the June 2013 flooding \n",
        "event to determine successes, challenges, lessons learned and recommendations. \n",
        "This report summarizes the After Action Report of the June 2013 High River Flood in \n",
        "respect to the Town of High Rivers Emergency Management Program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although there were numerous organizations that provided support to the response, \n",
        "the scope and focus of the After Action Report is on the Emergency Operations Centre \n",
        "and the coordination role that it played in directing the overall response from June \n",
        "20 to the end of July. It is important to note that the report does not address the \n",
        "subsequent recovery/renewal operations that have taken place and continue to take \n",
        "place in High River.\n",
        "\n",
        "METHODOLOGY: \n",
        "\n",
        "Information for the After Action Report was compiled from several sources, including the following:\n",
        "\n",
        " an event chronology based on scribe notes, press releases, personnel feedback, and corroboration with \n",
        "partner agency timelines;\n",
        " analysis of ICS 221 demobilization forms collected from EOC response personnel by the Demobilization Unit \n",
        "in the EOC; \n",
        " facilitated interviews with more than 150 personnel, including: Town staff, non-governmental organizations; \n",
        "Family and Community Services and Emergency Social Services personnel from across the province, external \n",
        "response organizations, provincial government personnel and utility company personnel;\n",
        " collaboration on content development with Town staff personnel; and\n",
        " fact-checking and feedback from relevant organizations on specific sections of the report.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS: \n",
        "\n",
        "The report was developed from the perspective of the Town of High River, with the ultimate goal of providing lessons \n",
        "learned and recommendations for the improvement of its Emergency Management Program. As a result, the bulk of \n",
        "the interviews were conducted with Town employees. All recommendations in this report are from the perspective of \n",
        "the Town of High River for the Towns use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        " There were thousands of individuals who contributed to the response in High River. For logistical reasons as \n",
        "well as the specific scope of this document, it was not possible to collect feedback from all responders. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\f\n",
        " Interview requests were sent to key organizations and partner agencies, but staff turnover and availability \n",
        "meant that it was not always the individuals on the ground that provided feedback on behalf of their \n",
        "organizations.\n",
        " The focus of the report is on the functionality of the EOC, so organizations that primarily provided support to \n",
        "the field or on early recovery without a notable presence in the EOC were not included in this report.\n",
        " This report does not address either the concurrent or subsequent recovery/renewal operations that have \n",
        "taken place and continue to take place in High River.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The timeline is an approximation; in many instances it was not possible to determine the exact time of the event\n",

        "\n",
        "The Alberta flood of June 2013 was the largest natural \n",
        "disaster ever experienced in Alberta and one of the worst \n",
        "in Canada. Nowhere was the impact felt more severely \n",
        "than in the community of High River. Long accustomed \n",
        "to spring flood possibilities, the Town has a program of \n",
        "flood mitigation and preparedness, including keeping \n",
        "residents informed. No previous experience could have \n",
        "prepared the Town for the unprecedented volume of \n",
        "water that inundated the community on June 20, 2013.\n",

        "A combination of factors contributed to the rapid rise of \n",
        "rivers and creeks in the Bow River Basin. Environment \n",
        "Canada reported record amounts of rain fell over a \n",
        "72-hour period on already saturated ground. In the \n",
        "mountains to the west the rain was falling on snow, causing rapid release of the mountain snow pack, which was \n",
        "bigger than average after a high snowfall winter. Mountain mud slides and raging rivers caused widespread flood \n",
        "damage throughout many southern Alberta communities.\n",
        "\n",
        "By June 22 the 2013 flood had caused two fatalities in High River. In the immediate aftermath, approximately 13,400 \n",
        "people, 5,400 homes and a total of 6,300 structures were evacuated; thousands of businesses, homes, vehicles and \n",
        "Town facilities were damaged or lost. More than 1,100 pets were rescued while another 400 were fed and watered \n",
        "through home visits via boats. \n",
        "\n",
        "On June 27th, the Town asked the Government of Alberta to declare a provincial State of Emergency (SOE). The SOE \n",
        "continued until July 11 when High River was returned to a State of Local Emergency.\n",
        "\n",
        "The response to the flood event involved not only the Town of High River staff but considerable resources and personnel \n",
        "from local municipalities, the Government of Alberta, the Canadian Forces, RCMP, non-government organizations \n",
        "(NGOs), community organizations, businesses, churches, contractors and thousands of volunteers. More than 1,000 \n",
        "emergency management responders and operations staff worked to control the floodwaters, save infrastructure and \n",

        "anticipated. The Director of Emergency Management \n",
        "activated the Towns Emergency Operations Centre \n",
        "and it was operational by 5:30 a.m. \n",
        " Firefighters began door knocking in Wallaceville \n",

        "the need to evacuate. At 6:45 a.m. the first 911 call \n",

        "Management Agency (AEMA) and Alberta Municipal Affairs of the situation. A media release was issued to \n",
        "the local media.\n",
        " Up to this point in time, all of the flood protections were in place as planned but they were designed to limit the \n",
        "damage caused by a 750 cms flood event. High River was about to get inundated by water of a magnitude never \n",
        "before experienced (upwards of 1750 cms).\n",

        " At 8:30 a.m. road access to the Beachwood neighbourhood was lost, and the decision was made to evacuate the \n",
        "SW area of High River. Changing conditions throughout town including the lifting and displacement of the CP rail \n",
        "tracks made it apparent that this was a much larger flood than had ever been experienced. \n",
        " The river forecast update received at 9 a.m. indicated the flow rate for the Highwood River was now estimated to \n",
        "reach 1270 cms by mid-afternoon.\n",
        " Communication between the EOC and field staff became a challenge because of high radio traffic. \n",
        " The River breached its banks at Centre Street and downtown High River began flooding. Power problems escalated. \n",
        " By 10 a.m., flood waters were observed to reach the main floor of the TELUS building, creating further \n",
        "communication issues. The Town of High River website crashed due to extremely high levels of traffic. Website \n",
        "access was then intermittent over the next few days. Communication issues escalated as the Primary Rate \n",
        "Interface (PRI) for the TELUS phone lines failed, compounding challenges to communicate with citizens, Town \n",
        "and emergency operations staff.\n",
        " By 10:30 a.m., all schools and seniors centres had been evacuated to the Highwood High School, and parents \n",
        "were arriving to pick up children. Operations staff was working to protect the Water Treatment Plant. Both the \n",
        "hospital and the Town Hall had sandbag berms in place.\n",
        " The town suffered a major loss of telecommunications capabilities when the mobile phone network failed at 11:00 a.m. \n",

        "with door knocking in order to alert remaining residents to evacuate.\n",
        " The EOC was relocated to the Fire Hall, but most EOC equipment was lost during this evacuation due to the quickly \n",
        "rising high water levels. Radio communication failures were increasingly affecting operations. The EOC abandoned \n",
        "its attempts to protect infrastructure and focused solely on rescuing residents.\n",
        " At 11:30 a.m. the Town of Nanton was called to open a Reception Centre for High River residents, and the centre \n",
        "was open within the hour. With flood waters topping Little Bow Canal and reaching 12th Avenue, the decision was \n",
        "made to evacuate the Highwood High School Reception Centre to Nanton. \n",
        " By 2 p.m. evacuation of the remaining SE area of town was under way. Within the hour, an advance party of the \n",

        "\f\n",
        "Highwood High School to Nanton before the highway was closed. Other evacuees were re-routed to Blackie.\n",
        " At approximately 3 p.m. the decision was made to re-locate the EOC from the Fire Hall to Nanton, because of the \n",
        "potential for the Fire Hall to flood. Highway closures resulted in only some EOC staff arriving, while others were \n",
        "routed to the Fire Hall at Heritage Pointe. The community of Blackie was asked to open a Reception Centre for \n",
        "evacuees at their site.\n",
        " Just before 4 p.m. the mandatory evacuation of High River was declared; however, the lack of working communication \n",
        "networks meant the order could not be well communicated.\n",
        " Water began to backflow from downstream and flow into northeast neighbourhoods that had not been previously \n",
        "flooded.\n",
        " Over the next few hours, rescues took place by whatever means were available over the now inundated streets. \n",
        "Search and rescue teams assisted 38 people who were unable to evacuate their homes on their own. Helicopters \n",
        "could not take pets, so additional coordination was required to find alternative means for residents with pets.\n",
        " At 8 p.m. on June 20th, the decision was made to return the EOC to the Fire Hall in High River, since the flood \n",
        "waters had not reached the facility. \n",
        " The Alberta River Forecast Centre indicated that the Highwood River had crested at an estimated 2000 cms at \n",
        "around 9 p.m. Highway 2 southbound was reopened, but 498 Avenue had to be closed. The EOC was notified that \n",

        " At 6:30 a.m. on June 21, the EOC ordered a search of all town residences to ensure that people had been evacuated. \n",
        " By mid-day on the 21st, the Blackie Reception Centre was full. The Nanton Centre increased its capacity to \n",
        "take more residents. A boil water advisory was issued as a precautionary measure. Operations personnel were \n",
        "continuing their efforts to restore access to the water treatment plant. While pressure was maintained in the water \n",
        "system, wells had to be shut down. \n",
        " During the afternoon and evening, additional resources continued arriving to provide support, from neighbouring \n",
        "municipalities, the RCMP and more Armed Forces personnel to bring that complement up to almost 400 people.\n",
        " Reports continued to come in of missing people. The RCMP added additional resources to conduct home search and \n",
        "rescues. At 6 p.m. the mobile phone network was restored which provided some relief for communication issues. \n",
        " The issue of pet rescue began trending on social media.\n",

        " The morning of June 22nd, the EOC reviewed options for how best to limit water movement and facilitate dewatering \n",
        "of flooded areas. The decision was made to build a berm on 2nd Avenue to assist dewatering efforts. It was \n",
        "determined that 80% of the Town was without power. Fortis transferred its command centre to High River and \n",
        "began working to get power on for the Towns mainline and lift station.\n",
        " The Town of High River and MD of Foothills representatives met at Heritage Pointe at 8:30 a.m. to begin planning \n",
